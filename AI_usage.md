# AI Usage Declaration

**Author:** Benoît Guignard  
**Project:** Swiss Inflation Forecasting  
**Course:** Advanced Programming 2025 - HEC Lausanne  
**Date:** December 2025

## AI Tools Used
- **GitHub Copilot (VS Code Extension)**: Suggested code and drafted document.
- **ChatGPT (GPT-5.2)** : Technical discussions and problem solving 

## How AI Was Used
AI tools were used as an assistant to speed up routine work and improve clarity. The final design choices, implementation decisions, and validation were done by me.

### 1) Code Development and Review

- Refine Python functions
- Suggest safer/cleaner structure code
- Error handling patterns
- Code comments for complex logic

### 2) Debugging 

- Data type mismatches 
- Syntax errors, logic errors

### 3) Learning New Libraries

- Understanding scikit-learn, scipy, networkx APIs
- Statistical methods: stationary bootstrap, hierarchical clustering
- Vectorization techniques for NumPy/pandas performance

### 4) Report and Documentation Writing

- Improve the clarity and structure of the written report
- Help with Pandoc/LaTeX formatting details 
- Help synthetize many pages of initial findings into a concise report

### 5) Verification 
To ensure correctness and academic integrity:
- I reviewed and edited all AI generated text and code.
- I manually validated that external dependencies and citations align with actual usage (e.g., removed libraries that were not used).

## What AI Was NOT Used For
1. **Research Design**: Reasearch question formulation, panel design, stress period definitions
2. **Data Selection**: Provide the underlying datsets.
3. **Result Interpretation**: All conclusions and concept behind results
4. **Critical Analysis**: Limitations, future work, research implications

## Notes on Transparency & Learning Outcomes
AI outputs can be incorrect or overly confident. For that reason, AI suggestions were treated as drafts and always checked by:
- reading the code,
- running the scripts,
- comparing outputs against expectations and the written report.

AI tools accelerated the learning of the statistical computing (models, benchmarks, errors), the python ecosystem (many libraries that I didn't know) and how to academicly write.
